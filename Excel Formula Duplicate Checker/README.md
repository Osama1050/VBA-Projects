# Excel Formula Duplicate Checker
This project uses Excel VBA to check for duplicate formula parts in a selected column of a file. 
It allows the user to select a file and enter a column letter to check. 
It then splits each formula in the column into its parts and compares them with other formulas in the same column. 
It returns the formula parts that are used more than once and the cells that contain them. 
This project helps to identify and avoid redundant or inconsistent formulas in Excel.

# Instructions
